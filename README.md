# automated-software-testing

To make my code both functional and secure, I applied boundary value analysis and mutation testing to validate every requirement and catch regressions. I interpret user needs by mapping each test case directly to specific statements, adopting a test-first mindset that surfaces hidden assumptions. My design approach emphasizes testable components with clear interfaces, parameterized tests to reduce redundancy, and disciplined reviews to minimize technical debt.
